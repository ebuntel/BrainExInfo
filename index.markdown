### Introduction

Time series are generated at an unprecedented rate in domains ranging from finances, health care and weather forecasting to education and economy. Collections composed of heterogeneous, variable-length and misaligned times series are best explored using dynamic time warping tools. However, the computational costs of using elastic distancesoften result in unacceptable response times. We are adressing the above challenges with BrainEx. BrainEx is an interactive system incorporating pairs of point-wise distances and their warped variants to achieve near real time responsiveness required by human interaction while yielding highly accurate results.  BrainEx is a fast and efficient solution to the challenge of using expensive-to-compute warped distances over large datasets, with response times 3 to 5 orders of magnitude faster than competitor systems.
